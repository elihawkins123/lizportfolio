        <p>
            Hello! Welcome to my professional Protfolio! I have always had a desire to learn had to code and want
            this to be 
            my life long career. Before this, I graduated from WSU with a BA in English teaching and have been
            teaching for
            five years. I love education and greatly value what our educators do for community, but my passion
            lies with coding. 
            When I'm not working, I'm spending quality time with my family. I enjoy reading, running, cooking, and
            learning
            how to code.
